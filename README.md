# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Project Reflection
### Generating Path Points
The model code to generate path points is largely reference to project walkthrough. The code is from `line 382-486`: firstly, prepare two vectors `ptsx` and `ptsy` to store anchor points we obtain later for spline library to generate smooth curve. The starting point is current car state and one step before. If we have previous, then the last 2 points would become our starting points. (`line 393-416`)

Next, we use map waypoints data to find positions are 30, 60 and 90 meters ahead and transform them to Frenet coordinates and also push back those 3 points into our vectors. (`line 418-430`)

With these 5 points, we initiate a spine instance and fit in local car coordinates for easier calculation. To deal with latency and also avoid abrupt transition, we first put the previous path into our new path. Then we used our fitted spline to fill up the rest of total 50 path points. (`line 443-486`) The methodology is illustrated in the project walkthrough, we used 30m target distance ahead and reference velocity to calculate discrete points on the sline curve. The calculated points were then transformed back to global coordinates and push back to new path.

The spline turned out working greate and generate smooth path points transistion to avoid large acceleration and jerk in order to pass the project requirements.

### Lane Change Model
The lane change algorithm code is at `line 286-380`.

First, if we have previous path points, we will then use `end_path_s` and `end_path_d` to generate smooth path. Then, we use `car_d` to find the current lane and setup some flags to keep tracks on cars on left/righ and/or ahead for lane change reference. We also have a flag to determine if lane change action is desired. (`line 280-295`)

Second, we loop through all detected vehicles from sensor fusion and extract their mobility data. Then, we calculate which lane each car is at according to the d value. (`line 297-330`)

Next, for all the cars that is within -15 to +30 meters range of the ego car, we check if: (`line 332-357`)

(1) Car is in the same lane, record car ahead and if its speed is slower than speed limit -5 MPH, flag `lane_change` as `true`.

(2) Car is in left the lane, record car at the left.

(3) Car is in the right lane, record car at the right.

Lastly, if we see a car is close ahead (30m) and moving slower (speed limit -5), we first check if left or right lane is clear and safe to make a lane change. If so, we make a lane change, else we reduce the speed to avoid collision. If no close ahead car, and current speed is slow, we gradually increase speed to close but not exceeding speed limit. (`line 359-380`)

### Performance
Under simulator environment, my code works reasonalby good. It keeps the ego vehicle to gently accelerate/deccelerate and plan smooth path. There is no large/discomfort jerk nor collision to other vehicles. When driving behind slow vehicle, the ego car is able to make lane change and only does it when the adjacent lane is clear and safe to do so. 

## Original Project README
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
